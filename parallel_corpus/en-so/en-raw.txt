You can't earn grace. Salvation is by grace through faith, and this is not our own doing but is the gift of God (Ephesians 2:8). Since all of us deserve hell, are unable to earn paradise, are dead in trespasses and sins, are spiritually blind and deaf, are blinded by the prince of this world (Satan), because of all these things only God can save us by translating us from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of God.

It is only by His grace (which is undeserved, otherwise grace would no longer be grace) that sinners are justified.
